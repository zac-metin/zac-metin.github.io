    Programming seems to trigger me often, into a state of amused frustration, where I am laughing at myself and the weird
    errors that I have no idea how I've generated but also frustrated because I don't even know what I need to fix.
    I guess the solution to that is to try to amplify the amused part until the frustration disappears faster and faster.

  a train quickly getting stuck in snow. </p>
