    <p align="center">From looking at the Websites in Zen Garden, I think the main thing I want to take away from it is
    overlaying text on top of images, though I'm still not sure how to do that yet. Linear gradient background seems useful
  as well. I want to work on a side menu bar as well, but not sure exactly what style yet.</p><br>
  <p align="center">An analogy for HTML CSS and DOM would be in editing a video. The html is the encoded video clip/the pixel signal that the computer
    then uses to generate the image. The css is the effects applied to the video clip eg colour grading and special effects, and the DOM is the video edit
    timeline where the clips are ordered.</p><br>
    <p align="center">Boxifying a website is blocking out the layout in a grid arrangement of boxes. The box model is a way of working with HTML to design
      and lay out a website, because HTML only understands layout in relation to an overall grid.</p>
