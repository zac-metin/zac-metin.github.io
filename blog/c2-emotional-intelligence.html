    <p align="center">Mindfulness is something I've been pretty interested in and actively working on for the
    past two years. What I hadn't really come across before was the analytical reasoning behind it displayed in
    Search Inside Yourself. I think its interesting that the author chose to examine the neurological causes and
    changes behind it. Probably this is the best way to get software engineers who are used to thinking very rationally
    to understand mindfulness in an objective field. </p><br>
  <p align="center">The two minutes of mindfulness was a good jump back into mindfulness meditation which is something
    I always want to do but keep earmarking for the next day, or the day after that. I should start trying to form two minutes
    of mindfulness as a habit, probably in terms of forced breaks at EDA as I think I haven't been taking enough breaks at the
    moment.</p><br>
    <p align="center">My general thoughts on mindfulness is that it needs to be taught on a much wider scale, ideally to
      kids starting school. I think this is being tested in some schools in isolation and showing great results. It's importance
      is so understated though. I think so many detrimental behaviours in the world from both individuals and organizations would
      cease immediately through mindfulness, and not even mastery of mindfulness, just a simple base level. But instead you have
    individuals who aren't necessarily bad people on an objective level but have a low level of awareness and mindfulness carrying out
  harmful ego-driven behaviour while lacking the emotional intelligence to even consider the effects of their behaviour on others. /rant
