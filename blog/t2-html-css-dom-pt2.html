      Grid based design is designing your website on a 2 dimensional grid so that you are more in control of the layout. Responsive design
      is important because people are viewing websites on a variety of different screen sizes and resolutions and we want all of them to have
      a good user experience on their device when viewing our page, even if they wasted 1100 on the newest rapidly depreciating iphone or samsung
      that may or may not explode in their face. Regardless, prior to said explosion they should be able to see the website well on their device.

  <p align="center">Semantic structures are structures that give information about what is inside them. This is usually a good thing in web design,
  but its also important to remember that the less information you give, the more underground you are, and in 2017 being an underground hipster is almost still cool.</p><br>
