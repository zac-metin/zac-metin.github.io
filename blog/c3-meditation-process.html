    <p align="center">The process over product method helped me to come to terms with spending about three hours trying to rearrange
    the website when working with larger screens in a way that just didn't work but helped me to understand the Bootstrap framework
  grid system a lot better, and got me better at using media queries.</p><br>
  <p align="center">The main thing I took away from the second chapter of Search Inside Yourself was the idea of not being so self critical
    when the mind wanders during meditation and to not see it as a failure. I think the gym analogy was quite helpful in seeing distractions
    as actually strengthening the mind's ability to create focused attention.</p>
