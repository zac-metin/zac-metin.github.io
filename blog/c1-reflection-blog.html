<p align="center">I think the EDA experience is something that should be more widespread especially in fields where qualifications are non-essential.<br><br>
  Spending 3 years at Otago University I found the process to be a somewhat draining both in terms of time and money, while the qualification gained<br>
  didn't actually ensure a job in the industry at all (film).I think NZ universities enjoy the 'restaurant' mindset mentioned in the Dev Bootcamp video<br>
  and that's understandable since they collect monstrous amounts of course fees each year.<br><br>
  <p align="center" >Having done some filming for EDA prior to the course I already had an understanding of the culture and the course in general so its <br>
    hard to comment on any new impressions, but as someone who learns a lot better in groups than working solo I think the cohort system is <br>
    really condusive to accelerated learning, and again this is another sector where university is somewhat lacking. I think the lecture system<br>
    is really outdated and employed only due to convenience and cost (allows low teacher to student ratio).<br><br>
    <p align="center">I'm definitely looking forward to spending more time working with people who are also motivated to learn web development. I am also really<br>
      keen to get more into meditation as its something I've always put off due to "not having enough time" so hopefully EDA will force me to do <br>
      more of this, as it has such a beneficial effect that its really annoying that I always put it off for later.<br><br>
    <p align="center">I am excited about the amount of stuff that I will be able to create, I already have a bunch of ideas floating about for what kind of apps I<br>
      want to work on as part of my study. I am definitely interested in synthesizing my current field with coding, and working towards adopting 360 degree video and VR<br>
      along with the code needed to create interactive platforms. I think this technology hasn't been taken on as quickly as it should and I expect in 5 years it will be<br>
      very big. I'm not nervous yet but I think the nerves will probably kick in about a week before the intensive bootcamp. But doing videos for EDA has definitely made<br>
      me feel already comfortable in the space (which I took for granted until I actually started) and also interviewing heaps of graduates definitely makes the course feel<br>
      more achievable.</p>
