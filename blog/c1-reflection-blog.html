<p align="center">I think the EDA experience is something that should be more widespread especially in fields where qualifications are non-essential.<br><br>
  Spending 3 years at Otago University I found the process to be a somewhat draining both in terms of time and money, while the qualification gained
  didn't actually ensure a job in the industry at all (film).I think NZ universities enjoy the 'restaurant' mindset mentioned in the Dev Bootcamp video
  and that's understandable since they collect monstrous amounts of course fees each year.<br><br>
  <p align="center" >Having done some filming for EDA prior to the course I already had an understanding of the culture and the course in general so its hard to comment on any new impressions,
    but as someone who learns a lot better in groups than working solo I think the cohort system is
    really conducive to accelerated learning, and again this is another sector where university is somewhat lacking. I think the lecture system
    is really outdated and employed only due to convenience and cost (allows low teacher to student ratio).<br><br>
    <p align="center">I'm definitely looking forward to spending more time working with people who are also motivated to learn web development. I am also really
      keen to get more into meditation as its something I've always put off due to "not having enough time" so hopefully EDA will force me to do
      more of this, as it has such a beneficial effect that its really annoying that I always put it off for later.<br><br>
    <p align="center">I am excited about the amount of stuff that I will be able to create, I already have a bunch of ideas floating about for what kind of apps I
      want to work on as part of my study. I am definitely interested in synthesizing my current field with coding, and working towards adopting 360 degree video and VR
      along with the code needed to create interactive platforms. I think this technology hasn't been taken on as quickly as it should and I expect in 5 years it will be
      very big. I'm not nervous yet but I think the nerves will probably kick in about a week before the intensive bootcamp. But doing videos for EDA has definitely made
      me feel already comfortable in the space (which I took for granted until I actually started) and also interviewing several graduates definitely makes the course feel
      more achievable.</p>
