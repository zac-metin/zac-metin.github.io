    <p align="center">
I assume this question is relating to code but I haven't actually solved any coding problems in an elegant way.
So instead I've only got a film example where we had to shoot with a window in the background but the light from
the window was blowing out the highlights and making it difficult to correctly expose the entire shot, but closing the
window meant there wasn't enough light. So what I did was filmed the footage with the areas not near the window
exposed properly, and let the highlights clip so the window was glaringly white. I then doubled the footage onto itself and
created a mask over the window to exposure correct the window only while leaving the rest of the shot at its normal exposure.

Pseudocode: I like the idea of pseudocode and I think its a good practice even if you aren't stuck.<br><br>
Trying Something: Trying Something is generally good and I've found it achieves a lot more than Trying Nothing.<br><br>
Rubber Ducky Method: I feel like Javascript is already driving me insane so I don't want to take that a step further by talking
to inanimate objects. I also don't own a rubber ducky, sadly.<br><br>
Reading Error Messages: One of my favourite pasttimes, this is a pretty effective way to pinpoint exactly where I've screwed up <br><br>
Console Logging: Kinda redundant compared to debugger, plus it reminds me of Codecademy so I steer clear of this<br><br>
Googling: This is good for stuff that you aren't sure how to do rather than debugging stuff you've already tried, generally someone
has already tried what you're attempting and done in it in a much better way<br><br>
Asking Peers For Help: Has been very helpful so far. <br><br>
Asking Coaches For Help: Seems a bit extreme.<br><br>
Improving Your Process With Reflection: Sometimes having a nap and looking at it either after that or the next day has worked.<br>

  <p align="center">The Mozilla documentation was not very clear to me but as I understand it the following functions are:<br><br>
    filter() - within the filter ( ) brackets a function is called. The function will filter out any array elements that don't meet the
    function's specified conditions and return the array with only the elements that passed the function's 'test'. <br><br>
    reduce() - applies a function to the elements of the array, that reduces them to a single value. Given this I think it has to
    be mathematical (eg involving operators). Concatenation and such...?!?<br><br>
    map() - applies a function to the elements on an individual basis. So if we want to muliply everything by 10, we can do that to every
    element of the array, individually.<br><br>
