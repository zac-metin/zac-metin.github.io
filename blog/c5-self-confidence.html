    Search Inside Yourself claims mindfulness and self-awareness are synonymous. In how I percieve them
    I would say I feel there's a slight difference where they are the same state but mindfulness is a
    more active version of the more passive self-awareness, and self-awareness is the result of practicing
    mindfulness. Basically self-awareness = habitual mindfulness.

  <p align="center">The practice of body scanning was quite interesting as a meditation practice as I
    have tried something similar with the goal being only to get to sleep rather than meditate. I also
  think that the blogging we do for EDA is a kind of 'unfiltered brain dump', or at least for me it is,
  I feel like I have been using this blog as a journal which unfortunately other students have had the
  misfortune of occasionally reading. Probably if I took more time on these blog posts it would be interesting and informative instead of verbal diarrhoea.
But according to Search Inside Yourslef journalling has some pretty crazy increases in positive results so I will
continue to spew unfiltered thoughts into my blog rather than writing something good.</p>
<p align="center">Emotions Are Not Me is in my opinion a pretty natural conclusion from practicing mindfulness.
   Unfortunately it can be very hard to identify being in the midst of strong emotions as they tend to bring you
   into a state of unconsciousness (unconsciousness in the sense of low-self awareness and not being conscious of
   your emotions, as opposed to literal unconsciousness). This means that in order to treat your emotions experientially
   it has to become habit to identify the early signs. Because if you don't have these systems in place, you will only register
   these emotions after the 'car crash', if you don't have practices in place to notice yourself 'speeding' emotionally. What a cringey
   metaphor, I'm gonna stop writing now.
