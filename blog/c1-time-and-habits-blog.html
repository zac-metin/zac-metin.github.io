    <h1 align="center">Time and Habits</h1>
<p align="center">I definitely noticed that I have a lot of internal resistence when it comes to time management and productivity based techniques<br><br>
Most systematic and structures techniques listed here such as Pomodoro just don't work with my personality type. I can't stand using Toggl. So the article<br>
"Seven Counterintuitive Ways To Be Insanely Productive" appealed to me a lot, despite the clickbaity title. From the start it matched the feelings I<br>
already had about these techniques and so I was a lot more open to what the writer had to say about time management.<br><br>
<p align="center">I especially liked the notion of ebb and flow rather than robotic static-state time management, I think this is why I don't like structured time<br>
  management, because it is robotic, and we aren't robots. I was feeling guilty after course started when taking time out for myself, but this article<br>
  is helping me to realize this is an essential aspect of productivity. I also love the quote "Just because something doesn't produce a measurable result<br>
  doesn't mean it's not productive". I think this is a great way to think during a bootcamp experience.<br><br>
<p align="center">I also liked the meditation and mindfulness articles as its something I've been exploring for about a year prior to starting the course<br>
  and again is something that is having highly positive (but hard to measure) results. It is amazing how effective meditation is at not just bringing you <br>
  back from a state of stress, but also preventing the state of stress from even occuring at the first place. Being aware of how having a long list of tasks<br>
  affects me mentally allows me to disengage from thoughts that pop up about time-shortage or other stressful and unhelpful notions. I think in physical activity<br>
  stress can play a crucial role in performing at 100%, but in mental endeavours I think it is next to useless and so it is very effective to be able to just spot<br>
  precursors to stress and mentally dismiss them to learn and work in a relaxed state.<br>
