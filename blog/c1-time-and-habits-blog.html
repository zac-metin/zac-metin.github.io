<p align="center">I definitely noticed that I have a lot of internal resistence when it comes to time management and productivity based techniques<br><br>
Most systematic and structures techniques listed here don't really work with my personality type. I am not a fan of Toggl either. So the article
"Seven Counterintuitive Ways To Be Insanely Productive" appealed to me a lot, despite the clickbaity title. From the start it matched the feelings I
already had about these techniques and so I was a lot more open to what the writer had to say about time management.<br><br>
<p align="center">I especially liked the notion of ebb and flow rather than robotic static-state time management, I think this is why I don't like structured time
  management, because it is robotic, and we aren't robots. I was feeling guilty after course started when taking time out for myself, but this article
  is helping me to realize this is an essential aspect of productivity. I also love the quote "Just because something doesn't produce a measurable result
  doesn't mean it's not productive". I think this is a great way to think during a bootcamp experience.<br><br>
<p align="center">I also liked the meditation and mindfulness articles as its something I've been exploring for about a year prior to starting the course
  and again is something that is having highly positive (but hard to measure) results. It is amazing how effective meditation is at not just bringing you
  back from a state of stress, but also preventing the state of stress from even occuring at the first place. Being aware of how having a long list of tasks
  affects me mentally allows me to disengage from thoughts that pop up about time-shortage or other stressful and unhelpful notions. I think in physical activity
  stress can play a crucial role in performing at 100%, but in mental endeavours I think it is next to useless and so it is very effective to be able to just spot
  precursors to stress and mentally dismiss them to learn and work in a relaxed state.
