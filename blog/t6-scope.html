    <h1 align="center">Scope</h1>
    <p align="center">
Scope is Javascript's way of placing limitations on variables. These poor innocent variables think they are unique and that they can do anything and be anything.
But once Javascript makes these variables local, they are limited and another version of the same variable can exist in a different function locally. It's not right.
    </p>
  <p align="center">
Global variables can be accessed from anywhere, although there can be multiple versions of that variable getting modified by different functions. I think. That may actually be wrong but hopefully it isn't.
Local variables are only accessible within the function they are contained in, although sub-functions can access it too. I see it as a bubble where the main js file is a bubble where global variables exist, but if
you want to put the variable inside another bubble - a function - you can. And a variable can be accessed in smaller bubbles but can't escape into outer bubbles. I'm gonna save this analogy for job interviews.<br><br>
There are also block level variables if you use let instead of var to declare your variable or function. Basically everything I just wrote you can replace the word variable with function and it still applies hopefully. I don't know enough about Javascript to assert that with full confidence.
