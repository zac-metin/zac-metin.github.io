    <h1 align="center">Meditation Conversations and Daily Mindfulness</h1>
    <p align="center">Nobody was home at the time I chose to do this task so I had a mindfulness conversation with
    my dog Dakota (pictured below). She was not able to repeat what the conversation was about so I think the mindfulness was really
  a one way street in this instance and I was the only active listener unfortunately. But I don't like the idea in general
it seems a bit forced to awkwardly repeat what the conversation is about. Actively giving your attention to someone is a good aim but
the other supposed behaviours of a mindful conversation such as repeating or recapping afterwards seemed disingenuous to me. I think
a better way to have a mindfulness conversation would be to look beyond the actual words that someone is saying, as sometimes even simple
sentences about something inconsequential have a lot said in the persons body language, tone and what they don't say sometimes says more.</p><br>

  <p align="center">What I did do was go for a walking meditation which was quite good. I don't think its a good
  substitute to sitting meditation but it is a good addition to trying to bring mindfulness into everyday activities
especially since I have a ten minute walk to Dev Academy most days. So this will be the one of the three techniques
I will use to start trying to form a habit, and I think it will be easier to keep up than sitting meditation because
I have to do it anyway.</p>
