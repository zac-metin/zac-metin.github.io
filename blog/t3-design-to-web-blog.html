    <p align="center">A responsive site is one that adjusts itself based on the screen size of the device that
    it is being viewed on. This is important because nowadays people are viewing things on a range of devices and
    I'm pretty sure this is basically exactly the same question as the previous technical blog.</p><br>
  <p align="center">Except with discussing wireframes instead of boxifying, even though they are basically the same
  thing. So I don't really have anything else to elaborate on this topic. A wireframe is basically the end result of
boxifying on paper or digitally. I could go on about this topic for weeks, but I won't.</p><br>
