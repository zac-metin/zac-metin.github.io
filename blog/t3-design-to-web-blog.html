    <p align="center">A responsive site is one that adjusts itself based on the screen size of the device that
    it is being viewed on. This is important because nowadays people are viewing things on a range of devices and
    I'm pretty sure this is basically exactly the same question as the previous technical blog. Mobile first design is
  making sure the site is functional from mobile devices first then building up from there. This is important because mobile
functionality is generally the hardest to do, so getting this sorted first means you don't get it sorted for desktop then have
to tweak it for mobile constantly.</p><br>
  <p align="center">Except with discussing wireframes instead of boxifying, even though they are basically the same
  thing. So I don't really have anything else to elaborate on this topic. A wireframe is basically the end result of
boxifying on paper or digitally. I didn't do a wireframe this week, except in my head. There's no real way that I know of
to upload images from my head to this website, so you'll just have to imagine it. It was of course highly comprehensive and detailed
but you'll have to take my word for it.</p><br>
