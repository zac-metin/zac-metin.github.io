      I'm struggling a bit with Javascript as its a lot more logical than HTML/CSS and I think I am more suited to
      design based than strictly functional coding. I guess that suggests I am more likely to enjoy front end development? but
      not gonna assume that for sure yet. It's pretty exciting to see what it can do though (emphasis on the 'can', since
      most of the stuff I know it can do, I still can't do.)

    An everyday example of control flow would be an enthusiastic web development student coming across a glitchy
    and soul destroying website that may rhyme with Dodecademy. The student tries to put in the input that the website
    wants them to, but the website does not accept it. So in this control flow, the "if" statement is if the student gets
    it right, codecademy will do the output, which is a green button of relief, rarely experienced on this harsh website,
    and this will break the loop.
    The far more frequent alternative, "else" is when the student has left out a semicolon, space or nothing at all but for
    some reason the website still chooses not to accept the code. In this hypothetical control flow loop, else will return
    us to the start of the loop, where student then has to input a different set of code. This will repeat until either the
    code is right, or the student <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-maXEg5K8">feels like this</a> about the website,
    and skips on to the next exercise.

    The difference between arrays and objects actually may be only minor, I think the only real difference is that the
    arrays' data is not stored by name but I feel it is essentially doing the same thing. So if I create Array ["X","Y","Z"] versus
    var Array = new Object (){letter1: X,letter2: Y,letter3: Z}, we basically have the same thing but instead of numerical identifiers
    such as Array[0] or Array[2] we now have Array.letter1. I'm not entirely sure if it should be a colon or an = sign in the object
    because codecademy taught us two different ways of doing the same thing (multiple times too) for no reason other than to confuse the crap out of me.
    Functions are usually variables that perform a task but can also be classes of objects if framed in the right way, and therefore apply their properties
    to any object created under that class.
